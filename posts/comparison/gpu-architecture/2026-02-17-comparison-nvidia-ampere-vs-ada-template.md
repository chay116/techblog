# Scope

Architecture-level differences that may affect vAI kernels.

# Comparison Axes

| Axis | Ampere | Ada | vAI impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| SM behavior | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Cache hierarchy | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Tensor path | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Memory behavior | TBD | TBD | TBD |

# Code to Inspect

- `benchmarks/`
- architecture-specific kernel configs

# Reference Materials

- NVIDIA architecture whitepapers
- Nsight Compute metric reference

# Evidence Mapping

| Claim | Code path | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| TBD | TBD | TBD |
