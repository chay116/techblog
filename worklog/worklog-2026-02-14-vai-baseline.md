# Context

- Establish baseline metrics before aggressive optimization.

# Hypothesis

- A clean baseline will make later API/language/architecture comparisons reliable.

# Setup

- Fill in hardware/software and benchmark configuration.

# Implementation

- Add deterministic benchmark entrypoints and logging.

# Result

| Metric | Baseline | Current | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| frame time (ms) |  |  |  |
| kernel time (ms) |  |  |  |
| throughput |  |  |  |

# Analysis

- Pending baseline collection.

# Next

1. Record first reproducible baseline set.
2. Create first Vulkan vs CUDA experiment branch.
