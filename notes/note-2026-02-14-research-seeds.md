# Raw Observation

- Need consistent terms across Vulkan/CUDA/HIP/GLSL when comparing behavior.

# Evidence

- Early logs use mixed terms for similar concepts.

# Why it might matter

- Terminology drift makes cross-entry comparisons noisy.

# Follow-up experiment

- Define a canonical glossary page for execution/memory/sync terms.
